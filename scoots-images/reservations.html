                to as “the Renter”) whose particulars are recorded in the Rental Document. It is hereby agreed as
                follows:</p>

            <p> 1. The Lessor will let and the Renter will take the motor Vehicle, details of which are described in the
                Rental Document (herein referred to as “the Vehicle”), for the term of hire as described in the Rental
